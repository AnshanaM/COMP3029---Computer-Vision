# COMP3029---Computer-Vision
Germinated Oil Palm Seed Quality Classification  Using Transfer Learning with GoogleNet

## README

Due to memory limitations on Google Colab (which does not support high-RAM environments by default), we had to split our implementation across three separate notebooks to prevent session crashes.

## Notebook Structure & Execution Order

Please run the following notebooks in this order:

1. **FinalNotebook1.ipynb** – Covers Requirements 3 and 4  
2. **FinalNotebook2_1.ipynb** – Covers Requirement 6 (Part 1)  
3. **FinalNotebook2_2.ipynb** – Covers Requirement 7 (Part 2)

## Included Files

The following notebooks contain outputs from our final runs, which are included in our final report. However, some output cells may be missing or cleared when the files are zipped. To ensure results are preserved for your reference, we have also provided PDF versions of the notebooks (captured after our final run).

**Deliverables include:**

- `FinalNotebook1.ipynb`  
- `FinalNotebook2_1.ipynb`  
- `FinalNotebook2_2.ipynb`  
- `FinalNotebook1.pdf`  
- `FinalNotebook2_1.pdf`  
- `FinalNotebook2_2.pdf`  
- `FinalReportCV.pdf` – Our final report  
- `MODELS/` – Contains saved versions of our baseline and proposed models  
- `RESULTS/` – Contains performance metrics and evaluation results  
- `README.txt`  
- **Saving Augmented Dataset Screenshots** – Shows the creation and saving of the offline augmentation train dataset

## Important Note

The submitted `MODELS/` and `RESULTS/` folders are outputs from our final run and are used in our final report for reference **only**. These should **not** be included when running the notebooks in Google Colab.

To reproduce results properly, please ensure that you create **new empty directories** for `models/` and `results/` in your Google Colab Drive environment before execution.

## Setup Notes

Instructions for dataset preparation and required file directory structure are provided in `FinalNotebook1.ipynb`.
